# Log Analyzer

📊 **Log Analyzer** is a Bash script that scans `.log` files, counts critical errors, and generates a comprehensive text report.  
It’s perfect for **system monitoring** and **quick log analysis** on Linux servers.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `analyze_logs.sh` → the main Bash script  
- `logs/` → folder containing your `.log` files (or example logs)  
- `log_analysis_report.txt` → placeholder report generated by the script

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a **Linux environment** (native, WSL, or SSH).  
2. Place your log files in the `logs/` folder.
3. Change the permissions with `chmod +x analyze_logs.sh`
4. Run the script:

```bash
bash analyze_logs.sh

# or

./analyze_logs.sh
```

5. The report will be generated at: `logs/log_analysis_report.txt`

> The included `log_analysis_report.txt` is just a **placeholder**. The script will overwrite it with real data.

## 📌 Features

* Counts occurrences of `ERROR`, `FATAL`, and `CRITICAL` in log files
* Generates a **readable report** automatically
* Highlights when **too many errors** are found
* Works for **multiple log files** at once

## 🎯 Future Goals

* Add **email alerts** when critical errors exceed thresholds
* Include **graphical summary** of logs
* Support additional error patterns configurable by the user
